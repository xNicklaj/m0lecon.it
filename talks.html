            CPU vulnerabilities undermine the security guarantees provided by software- and hardware-security improvements. While the discovery of transient-execution attacks increased the interest in CPU vulnerabilities on a microarchitectural level, architectural CPU vulnerabilities are still understudied.
            <br>
            In this talk, we present AEPIC Leak: the first architectural CPU bug that leaks stale data from the microarchitecture without using a side channel. AEPIC Leak works on all recent Sunny-Cove-based Intel CPUs (i.e., Ice Lake and Alder Lake) and does not require hyperthreading enabled. It architecturally leaks stale data incorrectly returned by reading undefined APIC-register ranges. AEPIC Leak samples data transferred between the L2 and last-level cache, including SGX enclave data, from the superqueue. We target data in use, e.g., register values and memory loads, as well as data at rest, e.g., SGX-enclave data pages. Even if AEPIC Leak is a sampling-based attack, we introduce techniques to precisely influence from which page and offset the attack leaks from.
Our end-to-end attack extracts AES-NI, RSA, and even the Intel SGX attestation keys from enclaves within a few seconds. We discuss mitigations and conclude that the only short-term mitigations for AEPIC Leak are to disable APIC MMIO or not rely on SGX.

           Since the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown, the security community has put a lot of effort into discovering new speculative execution attacks but still built on top of variants of the same speculation techniques, for example, by mistraining yet another predictor, and much less attention was devoted to the analysis of the root causes of speculation itself.
This paper tackles the problem from a new perspective, closely examining the different root causes of speculative execution, and specifically focusing on the unexplored class of speculations based on machine clears (MC). By reverse engineering the root causes machine clear, such as Floating Point, Self-Modifying Code, Memory Ordering, and Memory Disambiguation, these events not only originate new speculative execution windows that widen the horizon for known attacks, but also yield two entirely new attack primitives which affect all major CPU vendors: Intel, AMD and ARM. The primitives are called Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI), used to inject speculative floating-point values in subsequent instructions and Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB) used to microarchitecturally desynchronize code and data, triggering speculative execution of stale code. The paper also presents an end-to-end FPVI exploit on the latest Mozilla Firefox browser, leaking arbitrary memory through attacker-controlled and speculatively-injected floating-point results in JavaScript, affecting millions of users. Finally, the paper presents a new root cause-based classification of all known speculative execution paths, to clarify the whole speculative execution attacks scene.

            Security products are often the ideal target for those who want to attack a system by weakening it from within. From encryption equpment to VPNs, from encryption software to chips, in recent years alarms have been raised about the possible presence of backdoors or serious vulnerabilities in products meant to be safe. How can we draw the line between paranoia and reality?

           In the last two decades, we have witnessed to the sophistication of malware 
attacks which, now, require advanced techniques and new approaches to be detected. AI-powered 
solutions can help in amplifying the subtle signals of sophisticated attacks and allow 
security analysts to take immediate actions. After a brief introduction on defensive 
artificial intelligence, we will dive into the aspects of defensive machine learning and 
show how advanced techniques can be used to detect real-world cyber attacks performed by 
famous threat actors. The last part of the presentation will explore how AI can be also 
used to enhance attackers' capabilities.

            Since their introduction, fault attacks has been used as a meaningful
            way to subvert a computation running on embedded devices. Historically,
            one of the first means of injecting faults were by using the lights
            emitted by a (homemade modified) flash camera. Such technology evolved,
            such that today there exists very expensive laser technologies, able to
            inject very precise faults on top notch devices. At the same time,
            projects like the chipshouter, from NewAE, propose for a few thousand
            dollars, electromagnetic means to inject faults. In this work we show
            that one can start working on fault attacks with 0$ by using a
            disposable camera flash and a bit of soldering to obtain a meaningful
            way to inject EM shots into a chip.

            Nowadays most of the (published) attacks are related to computers and servers. However, we are moving toward a future of micro electronic devices that will pervade not only industry and urban infrastructure, but our entire lives.
            In this new world, 5G technology will be the main glue in terms of connectivity and the Internet of Things will be subject to the same issues we're currently facing in information technology, but with a much higher risk as the security of both public and private critical infrastructure is at stake.
            In this session we will give an overview on how to address the security of interconnected electronic devices from both an attack and defense perspective.
            Starting from simple microcontrollers, which do not even have a MMU, we will analyze some of the most effective attack/defense techniques related to the intrinsic architecture of embedded systems.
            We will also review the main hardware features that make a micro controller potentially secure, provided that secure embedded programming strategies are adopted.
            At the end of the session, a smattering of modern cyber resilience strategies applied to connectivity will be given.

            The talk is about the escalation path we used to acquire the server(s) administrator credential during the cyber activities conducted for a large bank customer.
            The architecture we tested was designed by a customer's supplier as PoC to achieve a hybrid-working model while providing the same, if not higher, security standards the bank was providing to the usual in-house activities. Starting from a VDI system (Citrix), we have been able to overtake the virtual system bypassing the env restrictions and using the VDI as a jumping point to the (testing) internal network.
            Chaining different critical misconfigurations, we have been able to achieve different kinds of malicious actions, from sensitive data exfiltration till acquisition of  admin server(s) rights.
